# Welcome to Quiz Harry Potter!

The project consists of a quiz game about the Harry Potter Quiz.


## Project details:
The web quiz app, created with Next js. consists of a home page, on which they find a start game button, which when pressed starts the game. Then the player has 180 seconds to answer the total of 23 questions about 23 characters from the Harry Potter saga. If the available time runs out, as well as if the player finishes the quiz, a button appears to know the result, which leads to a modal in which the player has to attach his name to know his score. When the modal is sent, both the player's name and score are automatically sent to Firestore/Firebase to record the data in question.



## Steps to view the site


In our default terminal, we clone the folder by typing "git clone" + link:

1- git clone https://github.com/Jcruzcorti/HarryPotter

2- Then, we place ourselves in the root folder of the project, with the command "cd HARRYPOTTER" and install all the dependencies inside with the command "npm install".

3-Finally, in the terminal we carry out the command "npm run dev" or "yarn dev" and the web will open in the predetermined browser after a few seconds/minutes of waiting.
